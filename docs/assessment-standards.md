# Excelora Assessment Standards

This document is the implementation checklist for every interactive assessment. Read it before creating or changing an assessment. Chapter 1 is the reference implementation.

## Access and attempts

- Assessment availability follows the plan entitlement declared in the shared assessment configuration. Never hard-code a Premium requirement in an assessment page, hook, dashboard, or API route.
- Basic includes Chapter 1 and its assessment. Premium includes assessments for all chapters otherwise available to that student.
- A student assessment remains locked until every submodule in its chapter is complete.
- Tutor manual unlock is still required after the completion requirement is met.
- A student receives one timed attempt only. Closing and returning resumes the same attempt; submission or timer expiry permanently ends it.
- Arthur and other AI help must not be available on the student assessment page.
- Tutor preview is unrestricted, untimed, repeatable, and must never create or consume a student attempt.

## Plan entitlements

- Basic is a Chapter 1 product preview: Chapter 1 notes, video walkthroughs, progress tracking, and one timed Chapter 1 assessment attempt.
- Basic students cannot use Arthur AI. Enforce this in both the interface and the Arthur API; hiding the button alone is insufficient.
- Premium provides the full course according to the student's tutor-controlled chapter access, the corresponding assessments under the standard restrictions above, and Arthur outside assessment pages.
- Pricing and upgrade copy must match these entitlements exactly. Do not describe Basic as the full notes library or imply that its Chapter 1 video walkthroughs require Premium.

## Questions and answers

- Show one question at a time while keeping the question count and total marks visible.
- Every labelled question part or subpart must have its own answer box and storage key. Never combine `(a)(i)`, `(a)(ii)`, `(b)`, and similar parts into one response field.
- Keep question parts and answer boxes in the same order as the source assessment.
- Use consistent labels with a trailing colon: `Answer:`, `Answer (a):`, `Answer (a)(i):`, and so on.
- Answer labels and entered answers use the same font family, responsive size, regular weight, colour, and line-height as the main assessment text.
- Use the neutral website styling for answer boxes. Do not turn the box green after checking or locking it.
- The maths-input sidebar must insert rendered maths into the currently focused answer box, not raw LaTeX.
- Clicking an editable answer opens the maths-input sidebar. Hovering at the right edge opens it; leaving closes it smoothly using Arthur's transition and hover tolerance.
- The maths-input sidebar has no close cross.

## Confirmation and locking

- Drafts autosave without revealing correctness to a student.
- Before leaving an answered question, show a confirmation dialog containing every answer part for that question.
- A student-confirmed answer is permanently locked and immediately marked server-side.
- Server validation must reject attempts to alter any locked part or associated sketch.
- Final submission confirms and locks any remaining draft answers.
- Tutor preview may check an answer, see its marks, edit it, retry it, reset the preview, and start unlimited new previews.

## Marking and solution banks

- Every assessment requires a versioned, server-only solution bank before it can be released.
- Each mark-scheme checkpoint must target its specific question-part storage key so answers cannot satisfy the wrong part.
- Save question-level marks, total score, automated total, pending-review marks, marking version, and marking time.
- Mark confirmed answers immediately, but do not expose running correctness or scores to a student during an active assessment.
- Tutor-preview marking may return marks to tutors but must never expose the solution bank itself.
- Student results are shown only after submission.
- Sketches are excluded from deterministic marking until AI sketch review is implemented. Their marks must be shown as pending review rather than guessed or silently awarded.

## Result colours

Tutor preview uses one consistent result system in both the result badge and question navigation:

- Red: zero automated marks.
- Amber: some but not all automated marks.
- Green: full automated marks.

Student navigation must not use correctness colours during an active assessment; it may only communicate draft and locked state.

## Visual consistency

- Follow the existing Excelora/Notion visual language and spacing.
- Do not introduce one-off font families, weights, label sizes, button spacing, or coloured input backgrounds.
- Confirmation previews must use the same answer labels and neutral answer-box styling as the main question.
- Use the Chapter 1 assessment as the visual and behavioural reference before approving another chapter.

## Required verification

Before handing off any assessment change, run:

```bash
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
git diff --check
npm run build
```

Also test at least one correct, incorrect, and partially correct multipart answer in tutor preview, plus the student lock and one-attempt paths.
